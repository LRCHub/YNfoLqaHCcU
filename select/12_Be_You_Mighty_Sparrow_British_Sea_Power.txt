Everyone wanted to make them welcome in the empire's capital
And show them the admiration and regard they had won in Britain
By their magnificent effort during the war

When we get there
We'll go wandering
Through the wilderness
Getting in a mess

And if we find it
I keep on wondering
Here's another thing
We didn't know 'til now

We're not going home
We are not alone
No, we're not going home
From the sea to the land beyond
To the land beyond
To the land beyond
To the land beyond
